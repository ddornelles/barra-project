# Project 2 - Barra Quero

This project was developed by [David Dornelles](https://github.com/ddornelles) and [Uira Sampaio](https://github.com/uirasampaio) in a week for Ironhack’s second project in the web development bootcamp.

Inpired by Airbnb ṕlatform we created an application to connect beach lovers with onwers of beach tents that rent beach umbrellas, tables and other services. As a client you can search for your favorite beach, using google maps location api and check all the beach tents registered in the plaftorm in that region, you can choose one you like and make reservations.

As a beach tent owner you can easily register your beach tent, keep track of reservations made by clients, inform the price of your products and share some history about your business.
